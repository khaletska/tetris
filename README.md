## General Information
Our project is a fun and addictive web-based Tetris game, built using JavaScript, Golang, HTML and CSS. It's designed to run smoothly and consistently, with no lag or frame drops, and the controls are designed to be intuitive and responsive, making it easy to play for hours on end. We've also included a scoreboard so you can track your progress and compete with friends, and a pause menu so you can take a break and come back to it later.
